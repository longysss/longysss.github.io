1. **Yusi Long**, Shimin Gong, Sumei Sun, Gary C.F. Lee, Lanhua Li, Dusit Niyato. ["Lyapunov-guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Semantic-aware AoI Minimization in UAV-assisted Wireless Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13580), submitted to **IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications** (IF: 8.9), Major Revision, 2024. *We introduced a novel semantic-aware age-of-information (SAoI) metric that explores the trade-off between data freshness and semantic importance in a UAV-assisted wireless communication network via the Lyapunov-driven deep reinforcement learning framework.*
